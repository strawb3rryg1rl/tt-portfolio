<h2>Raccoons are very adorable and interesting animals, here are some fun facts about them!</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The name “raccoon” comes from the Algonquian word “aroughcun”, meaning “he who scratches with his hands”.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Raccoons are excellent climbers and can climb almost any surface thanks to their sharp claws and nimble paws.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Raccoons are very intelligent animals and have been known to solve complex puzzles and escape from captivity.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Raccoon babies are called kits.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Raccoons have excellent hearing, so good that they can detect even the movement of earthworms underground.</li>
    <br>
    <li>The mask-like markings on the raccoons face reduce glare and help with their night vision.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Raccoons are omnivores and opportunistic eaters, which means they feed on whatever is most convenient. </li>
    <br>
    <li>Raccoons are mostly solitary animals. As nocturnal creatures, they rarely venture out during the daytime, and they try to stay close to their den, only traveling far enough to get what they need to eat and drink.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Raccoons have often been thought to be related to dogs, cats, and weasels. However, with molecular analysis, it has been shown that they are actually most closely related to bears.</li>
