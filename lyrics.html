            </h1>
            <pre>
                She may contain the urge to run away
                But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
                Cetirizine your fever's gripped me again
                Never kisses all you ever send are full stops

                Do you know where the wilds things go
                They go along to take your honey
                Break down now, weep build up breakfast now
                Let's eat my love, my love, love, love

                Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
                The fear has gripped me but here I go
                My heart sinks as I jump up
                Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut

                Do you know where the wild things go
                They go along to take your honey
                Break down, let's sleep, build up, breakfast now
                Let's eat, my love, my love, love, love


                She bruises coughs, she splutters, pistol shots
                But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
                She's morphine queen of my vaccine
                My love, my love, love, love

                Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
                The fear has gripped me but here I go
                My heart sinks as I jump up
                Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut and

                She may contain the urge to run away
                But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
                Germolene disinfect the scene, my love, my love, love, love
                But please don't go, I love you so...

                Please don't go, please don't go
                I love you so, I love you so
                Please don't go, please don't go
                I love you so, I love you so
                Please break my heart

                Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
                I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
                Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
                I love you so...


                Please don't go, I'll eat you whole
                I love you so, I love you so, I love you so
